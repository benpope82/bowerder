>the bower component loader for browsers

Easly Import your components or libraries installed via bower to your project.

#### why shall i use it ?

 - If you pain to include bower components that require dependencies in your project, this is for you.
 - if you pain to show how to include your module pushed to bower registry, considering it dependencies, this is for you.
 - if you care about how many time a component will be included to your project considering work's subdivision and module's inclusion here and there, this is for you.
 
 Indeed, **bower** is a package manager, but without a good loader's utility, package's dependency and module philosophy are mis-used (sous-exploit√©) with usage of a simple `script` tag.
A best example to explain what i'm talking about is the conparaison with node modules usage. 
Althought conditions is little different, here is a place to better manage component we use throught bower in our project.
 
#### how to install ?

Considering it's for bower package manager, just do :
```sh
$ bower install
